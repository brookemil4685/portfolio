<p> It all started with a highschool hobby. In my free time I took on a second identity as, "Swagboss", the host of the infamous <i>No Judgement; Outside the Courthouse </i> podcast. It was widely popular amongst my small group of friends and a few of my peers who happened to be around whilst it was being recorded. The productions would mostly take place at parties or hangouts when I would whip out my phone and decide randomly that I wanted to interview people. The, "No Judgement" in the title pertains to the fact that everyone featured in the episode had an anonymous code name, and every real name said had to be bleeped out. Was it the lowest production quality possible? Yes. And did I record every episode using voice memos? Yes. But it was extremely fun, and it captured so many memories of my friends' and my highschool youth. Most importantly, this little free time project kickstarted my ideas of turning my hobby into a potential career. </p>

<p> In my Sophomore year Spring, I was in a journalism class that required the final project to be a story pertaining to a certain community. I chose the community of Evanston, and wanted to focus my reporting on Black businesses. I found an amazing couple that co-owned C&W ice cream parlor. Clarence and Wendy were so sweet and allowed me to center my project around them and what they've built. I wanted this podcast to replicate a more educational format, and I tried to base its style off of New York Time's, "The Daily". I learned a lot about how to use interviews within a podcast, how to present information in a way that interests the listeners, and how to use natural sound to tie my project all together. I also gained a lot of insight about Black owned businesses within the Evanston community, and about the inequalities <a href= "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17nPpCKEX4q8bcANQW2N2lxySu8RYr-lm/edit?gid=1674494828#gid=1674494828">all Black owned businesses</a> fight to overcome. I was so grateful that I chose to delve into this subject, and if I ever want to take a more informative route when it comes to my podcasting career, I would definitley feel confident in trying due to this experience.</p>

<p>In the present, I co-host a wonderful production named <i>Whiskers</i>. It all started when I told my assistant coach, Rich, that I was interested in podcasting. Luckily for me, he was too! He suggested we combine forces (with my experience in podcasting and his experience as an avid soccer podcast listener), and <i> Whiskers: about the Northwestern Women's Soccer Wildcats</i>, was born. With our differing schedulues, and the fact that we truly only interview people on the team who similarly live busy lives, we record as much as we can! It has room to grow, and calling the production consistent would be a large exaggeration. But Rich and I learn everyday. We learn what works and what doesn't, what we like and what we don't, and no matter what we changes we always have a blast recording. I hope that for me, <i>Whiskers</i> isn't endgame, and I hope it isn't for Rich either. I hope we can both use this project as a springboard into our careers as famous podcasters. No matter what, this podcast continues to remind me that a job is the most fun when it doesn't feel like work.</p>

     The Black Employer firm data is sourced from The Census Bureau's annual business survey for 2024. I organized the data needed for my column chart by putting it in a separate table (on another sheet), and used AI to help me turn each percentage into a overall comparable percentage, that could allow me to compare all my percentages at once. I imported my sorted data into flourish, and was easily able to create my column chart.
