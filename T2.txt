06:13 Speaker 4:
Back.

06:15 Speaker 5:
Yeah. My name is Morgan Roll. I am originally from Hereford, Maryland, which is north of Baltimore, which is a lovely, lovely place. Played college at Louisiana State University and then got into coaching right after college. So I was at Lo University Maryland for four years and then now I'm here. Boom.

06:34 Speaker 4:
That's

06:34 Speaker 3:
Fantastic. And we are thankful. We love

06:36 Speaker 4:
It.

06:37 Speaker 3:
Okay, so I guess what we can start with Jenny is what's your Northwestern origin story?

06:44 Speaker 4:
Northwestern Origin

06:45 Speaker 3:
Story? Like how did you get here?

06:48 Speaker 4:
Oh boy. Well, oh, I'm gonna think back there. So before here I was coaching at Minnesota, Aurora, which is,

06:57 Speaker 3:
Shout out Aurora. Aurora. You ladies are doing a great job. We

07:01 Speaker 2:
Love it. Yeah, I, I know you guys are good because <laugh>.

07:04 Speaker 4:
Yep. Before I came here, actually I, I knew I was coming to Northwestern. We played against you guys when

07:10 Speaker 2:
You saw me, you're like, that's

07:12 Speaker 4:
Was like, we got her. Yep. And so I was at Aurora fc, which is A-U-S-L-W League team up in Minnesota. A really cool, cool place. Brooke gotta come into it with 6,000 fans with no idea she was gonna be stepping in front of 6,000 fans. So that was a ton of fun. We

07:30 Speaker 2:
Lost a significant amount. I won't say, I won't say the actual score,

07:34 Speaker 4:
I also will not say that was all coaching, but it kind of No, I'm kidding.

07:37 Speaker 2:
<laugh>. I can see it. I can see it. Just

07:40 Speaker 3:
Joking. This is what sealed your

07:42 Speaker 2:
Job here. Honestly, that plays so cool.

07:44 Speaker 4:
It is really cool. They've done a really good job up there and we've, they've had a lot of really talented players go through there. But we, I decided I wanted to get back into college coaching. So before that I was in Utah, Utah Tech went to Minnesota, Aurora. So because of the organization, how exciting that was. And then decided I wanted to get back into college soccer. Northwestern kind of popped up. Richard Manning gave me a phone call on my way to a game and I was like, <laugh>, I have a cold call.

08:16 Speaker 4:
And I, I thought, 'cause the police had been calling me because somebody stole my, somebody stole my credit card when I was in Salt Lake the last time. And so the police had been calling me and so I had Salt Lake numbers and your number is from Salt

08:29 Speaker 3:
Lake, my number still

08:30 Speaker 4:
Oh one. And so I was like, hello <laugh>. He is like Rich manning, Northwestern Women's Soccer. And I was like, what <laugh>? And so we kind of chatted for a while. It was kind of kind of fun swapping some Utah stories and it kinda all went from there, got on on campus, fit in really well with these guys and

08:51 Speaker 2:
It knows It's been awesome.

08:52 Speaker 4:
The players are all right. Yeah, the players like it didn't really work out first, but we've gotten here. We built, we built

09:00 Speaker 3:
And Jenny just finished her second season. Second season,

09:03 Speaker 4:
Yeah. Woo.

09:05 Speaker 3:
On the way to fantastic number three. Third season, which will be Brook's fourth season. Crazy. Yes. Morgan, your Northwestern origin story. My

09:15 Speaker 5:
Northwestern origin story. I think I just got to find my career that I was like, I want to be in the big leagues. Like I want to coach the best of the best. And it was funny 'cause being in Maryland and then playing in Louisiana, I was like, I wanna

09:30 Speaker 4:
<laugh> <laugh>. I was like, it's gonna be so

09:32 Speaker 5:
Fun. And then this popped up and I was like, oh man, that's a really,

09:36 Speaker 4:
The tropic the tropics of Chicago.

09:38 Speaker 5:
So I came to the tropics of Chicago, I

09:42 Speaker 3:
Ct,

09:42 Speaker 5:
I had calls. So coaching is like just bizarre in that sense of how you kind of get to places that you get. But I've had some really good friends of mine that are coaches that knew Michael and said incredibly great things about him. So I trusted that for sure. And then applied, the funniest part of this is my phone interview. I had a coughing attack for the entire 45 minutes. <laugh>

10:05 Speaker 4:
<laugh>.

10:05 Speaker 5:
I like, I kid you not like would hack out a question mute die. Like I'm coughing up the storm in the background. I have tears rolling down my face. Oh my God. The whole 45 minute phone call. And I was like the biggest opportunity of my life, thus my, yeah. And I blew it. And then Michael was like, you didn't feel campus to start an interview. And I was like, and I went downstairs to my roommate, she's like, how'd it go? And I was like, terrible <laugh>. But I'm going there next week for an interview. That's awesome. But no, it's fantastic. And then got here and it felt like home and everyone was awesome and I was shown the big indoors.

10:38 Speaker 5:
So I was like, how often we train in here? And they're like, oh, whenever it's cold. I'm like sick. The tropics of Lake Michigan.

10:45 Speaker 4:
Honestly that was my first, when I came on campus, I was like, oh my god.

10:49 Speaker 5:
Yes. Like

10:50 Speaker 4:
I didn't know about this. I mean this wasn't when I was playing this, that wasn't around. So I didn't even know that that was a thing. Like I knew like the field of Northwestern is right on the lake. Which I think it always kind of surprises people that they're like, whoa, big lake. It's so big. And then we, you just like walk into the facilities and it's like, oh my god, this is amazing. So I mean, players and coaches alike all have that same feeling when they walk into the facilities and everything. So

11:18 Speaker 3:
Every day. Awesome for us.

11:19 Speaker 4:
Every day for, I swear every time we walk in I'm like, oh, that's so cool. Yeah.

11:25 Speaker 5:
Like I

11:25 Speaker 2:
Wanna post it every single time and I'm like,

11:27 Speaker 4:
I feel like these things <laugh>, I like keep on sending snaps to my friends and I'm like, it's

11:33 Speaker 3:
Like we all have a child and we wanna show it off. We

11:35 Speaker 4:
Do. Yeah, it totally. Morgan,

11:36 Speaker 2:
Have you ever asked Michael if he like knows that you had a coughing attack and moment during

11:43 Speaker 5:
Yeah. There was no shot. Like we've talked about it. There's no shot that he could not have. And he did.

11:48 Speaker 2:
He says

11:48 Speaker 5:
He he does. Yes. He was like, yeah, you still did. Well

11:52 Speaker 4:
He's like, he's like, you fought through it and we respected that. Yeah, you

11:55 Speaker 5:
Persevered. Like

11:56 Speaker 4:
You persevered. We need people to overcome adversity.

11:59 Speaker 3:
Was wonder reasoning why your answers were so short? Yeah, I was

12:01 Speaker 6:
Like, so

12:02 Speaker 2:
Just wanna breathe

12:03 Speaker 3:
One word. Breathe one word.

12:05 Speaker 2:
I was like,

12:05 Speaker 5:
Sorry, just gimme one second. And I like couldn't go downstairs to get water and inside I was bad. I was stranded. It was rough. But we made

12:11 Speaker 2:
It. Well

12:13 Speaker 4:
She's here.

12:14 Speaker 2:
She's here. Yeah. And you've both went a lot of different places before you came here. So what about Northwestern is remarkable to you? Because you were a gopher and a gopher and the gophers love her. We went to Minnesota this past year to play against 'em. Jenny took us for favorite spots and everybody loves Jenny. Yeah. And everyone we

12:34 Speaker 4:
Saw,

12:35 Speaker 2:
Everyone we saw who loved Jenny like just made us know that more people love Jenny. And then Jenny know we saw that that

12:42 Speaker 4:
Too. This whole thing. I was like, and I texted them before I went there and I was like, I need you guys to pump me up in front of the players. I haven't proven to them that I'm awesome yet. Yeah, no it was, that was a lot of fun actually to go back to that, to that space and be able to see my old friends, but then also, yeah. Nor we're gonna, Minnesota will always have place, place

13:04 Speaker 3:
A picture from that. Yeah.

13:05 Speaker 2:
We'll talk, we'll tag it in life slow. Yeah. But, but Northwestern speaking, like how is it, so why is it so remarkable?

13:14 Speaker 4:
I mean, like I said, well first of all the, the

13:22 Speaker 6:
<laugh>, she speaks less in the

13:25 Speaker 4:
Inanimate objects of it. Like we said, the facilities are amazing and I think that that's been, that's like a, a game changer on that. But I think other than that it's just, I mean the people that care so much about the program, the people that I work with, I can't say say enough good things about. It's just been so much fun coming into work every day, joking around with rich, joking around with Morgan. Like talking, talking about, yeah. Talking about, you know, anything random thought with Michael and I, it's not just soccer, it's kind of everything else.

13:59 Speaker 4:
And I think that that's, that's the atmosphere I always want to be in. And I, I hope and I think that that's what we, you know, give to the players as well. And I honestly, Brooke, I think you guys are awesome and I love working with you all, so that makes it really

14:13 Speaker 3:
Incredible. We're gonna mute that answer

14:15 Speaker 6:
<laugh> honestly. Please.

14:18 Speaker 4:
You

14:19 Speaker 3:
Cannot, players cannot know that.

14:21 Speaker 4:
Can't know it. I try to keep it to myself as much as possible,

14:24 Speaker 2:
But we a a couple of the players actually do listen to Whiskers. Oh. So they'll be happy to know this.

14:29 Speaker 4:
Yeah. Good. I mean, I, I didn't need, it was about time I said it.

14:34 Speaker 6:
We've been waiting for on

14:36 Speaker 3:
Your skills every day I go watch a lot of soccer

14:41 Speaker 2:
Anyways. <laugh>,

14:42 Speaker 6:
What about for you Morgan?

14:45 Speaker 5:
I don't know, I, I feel like we really do things the right way here in like a space where it's like really caring about the whole person and it's like a huge commitment to everybody on our staff and kind of like how Jenny was saying, showing up here and us kind of all being on the same wavelength and then having department that's on the same wavelength and being able to pour in the student athletes that want the best of both worlds is an incredible opportunity. And I think that sets us apart just because you guys are elite in every setting that you step into. And it's us making sure we, you guys know that we're in your corner just being like, you guys are awesome the whole time.

15:19 Speaker 5:
And like you guys can take on the world and do anything and we truly believe it and we're here to help you guys through that whole process. So I think that sets us apart, just the student athletes that we work with and like the true Care and Valentine's Day coming up.

15:33 Speaker 4:
<laugh>, shout out Valenti. We're get, we're getting to that lovely, the photo at the bottom heart. I stupid. Alright, go out. Oh yeah.

15:48 Speaker 3:
Oh <laugh>. Oh for you, you two people. You got a glimpse of that

15:52 Speaker 4:
<laugh>. It was cute. It was cute. It was very cute.

15:56 Speaker 3:
My turn. Yeah. So what are your favorite moments? What's the pinnacle of coaching for you? The moment where you go like, oh that was special.

16:05 Speaker 4:
I've had a couple. So after I got done playing, I kind of took a break from soccer altogether. I kind of needed that mentally to take, take a little bit of time. And luckily one of my former teammates is also a coach and she got the head coaching job down at Utah and asked if I wanted to, this was over. Covid asked if I wanted to go down there and coach and once I, once I stepped back on that field, <laugh> <laugh>. But what really when I got back out there and was around like-minded people that were really hardworking and like working together in a team for one goal and then also being able to use the the, the wisdom.

16:50 Speaker 4:
The wisdom, the, the everything that I learned over my course of my career. Which was, you know, 20 plus years. No, nope, not 20 plus years. <laugh>

17:01 Speaker 4:
That old, that old. But at least, I mean maybe 20 plus years. Oh, around 20 probably. Yeah, probably it probably started around six. Yeah. I don't know when I started, I'm always impressed when people are like, I started playing soccer at five. I was like, how do you remember? I don't, I remember five, yeah, five or six probably. Okay, all right. Three I'm sure I'll ask my mom. But yeah, just being back around those kinds of players and being able to connect with them on the level of a soccer player but then also somebody that cares.

17:32 Speaker 4:
I think that those have been my things that I've cared about the most and I've, I'm most proud of is the connections that I've had to players being able to help them get better on the field, but also really caring about them as a human being. And hopefully, I mean empowered women empower women and I want to keep on empowering women to, to be their best selves on and off the field. So that's why I coach and why when I was back on the field I was like, this is where I feel like I can have the most impact and that's why I do it. And I, I've really enjoyed soccer and coaching because of that.

18:07 Speaker 4:
So you're here, you're here, you're here.

18:10 Speaker 5:
Awesome. I'd say one of the big moments, kind of similar to a little bit different from Jenny's path, my whole college career was hurt. So I was super disgruntled with what I thought was the sport and it wasn't the sport. So then when the career at LSU ended time there ended found my way back up in Maryland, being able to get back on the field and I'd always coach summer camps and kid camps and had like youth teams throughout college. But doing it in a newfound role was something that like just reignited that passion for the sport.

18:42 Speaker 5:
And I also kind of got to heal in that process and I was like, it wasn't the sport, it was my circumstances and learned and reflected a lot about just responses and bigger picture stuff and what that kind of taught me there. But then I'd say a extended moment kind of getting back to the question would be one of the first goalkeepers I worked with.

19:03 Speaker 5:
Like she was the epitome of why you do this. Like helping her gain confidence on and off the field through sport and then having her then transition that into life and just seeing her blossom was like one of the coolest things. And having her be the first like goalkeeper I got to really work with. So a lot of myself and her too. So it was kind of a human process for everybody as I was like 1, 1 22 in a job fresh out of college trying to like lead 21 year olds and I'm like, mom, how do I fill up my taxes? <laugh>,

19:34 Speaker 4:
I'm still doing that. Yeah. So like

19:36 Speaker 5:
When is that due? Also coming up tax season <laugh>. But no, it was one of those things that was, that was a more extended moment that was fantastic. But I'd say more of like a distinct moment was probably that that was freshman year feeding Stanford. Like just watching you guys enjoy that. Watching you guys like own it and being like, we are good enough, we are a great team. It's not just this like, oh we play a certain style and there's no outcome. Like we were playing really good soccer and then we got a really big outcome and that just led to the rest of that season being fantastic and again, doing it the right way from like a good soccer point was really cool.

20:16 Speaker 5:
But it was really awesome to watch you guys just like pop off after that and just have this like crazy confidence moving forward where you guys were just like instructible. So that was great.

20:27 Speaker 2:
I think that honestly I forget, I think I might have put that as my favorite memory really for my senior spotlight too. For like the same reasons, but I can't remember. So yeah, if so, me and Morgan get it. Catch

20:37 Speaker 5:
An interview watching Michael reacted. That was great too. There was like, we were all like, and there was like five seconds left and he just runs down the bench. He's like, oh, hot dog

20:45 Speaker 2:
<laugh>.

20:45 Speaker 5:
And I don't think I've ever seen him that animated. I was like, I was like, like flip a water. It was great.

20:53 Speaker 4:
I love that. That was great. That's

20:55 Speaker 2:
Awesome. Well now off the field speaking what.
