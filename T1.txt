00:00 Speaker 1:
Is your off field responsibility? Do you have that the team has no idea about?

00:05 Speaker 2:
I make sure the team knows about everything that I do. I know.

00:08 Speaker 1:
I was gonna say

00:09 Speaker 2:
I want, no, I want all the credit for everything. <laugh>. Jenny

00:12 Speaker 1:
Tell me, she's like, I did this, I did this.

00:15 Speaker 2:
I definitely did this for you Brooke. And I would like to thank you. <laugh>. <laugh>. Oh man. I think there's a lot of like back a lot of stuff that we do in the back of, at back end of coaching, like rewatching film cutting stuff. Like even trying to just become a better coach. I think that that's a huge part of it. Reading things to being able to understand that, being able to connect with all the players.

00:46 Speaker 2:
I mean, there's so many players on the team that it does take a lot of time. And I think that sometimes that is kind of lost of like, the one-on-one connection can only be so many with so many people at a certain amount of time. But regardless, there's a lot of logistics that have to be worked on with within the environment because you know, it's crazy to think how many things actually have to happen to get something done. Yeah. And so we have a lot, a lot of that.

01:17 Speaker 2:
But otherwise, you know, I normally just sit. Yeah, wait for your chair, trainer. Sit in my chair. Spin on circle. Sit around.

01:25 Speaker 3:
We play with

01:26 Speaker 2:
Poe. Hang out with Poe. Yeah. Nice Know Morgan. What? Mayor or Morgan has a better, we kind of

01:32 Speaker 3:
Covered, I mean yeah, just random office stuff that gets us from point A to point B. So we've had all the travel stuff with that equipment stuff.

01:43 Speaker 4:
You're not mentioning one thing that you both do a ton of that dance. How much time you spend on it?

01:49 Speaker 1:
Dancing.

01:51 Speaker 3:
Hype up po.

01:52 Speaker 4:
No, you order food. Oh yeah.

01:54 Speaker 2:
I was

01:54 Speaker 1:
Gonna say that too. Pain.

01:56 Speaker 2:
Well, I was, I mean like that the ordering of food is my, not just for you, maybe my least favorite thing in the world, but I do it and I keep a smile on, but I make sure I get a thank you from you. Yes. I was

02:10 Speaker 1:
Honestly gonna say that

02:12 Speaker 4:
Time to

02:12 Speaker 1:
Order

02:13 Speaker 2:
For 35 people. The logistic that was more so into the logistics. We do a lot of like the logistical work in the organization of like what that looks like. That does take a lot of time.

02:23 Speaker 3:
The deep care put into the foodie. Yeah.

02:25 Speaker 2:
I always run it by Morgan's a foodie and I am convenience. And so I do run a past her. I was like, what does this sound like? She's like, oh, maybe, maybe, maybe something else. I don't know. I'm like, all right.

02:38 Speaker 1:
I I was gonna say that because I think before I came to college I would think like, there's another staff. They're taking care of the hotels, they're ordering the food. And then when I got here and you guys were organ organizing it all yourselves, I was like, oh my gosh. That kind of sucks to do also all the time.

02:57 Speaker 2:
A lot. There's a lot that in the, in the vaccines of like the operations of everything. They're at <inaudible> quite a bit. Yeah. Yeah.

03:04 Speaker 4:
Okay. So we all have pet peeves. Name one thing a player will do or players do that your peeve that you're just like,

03:13 Speaker 2:
I let Morgan go first

03:14 Speaker 1:
Because you know what this, do you know him

03:16 Speaker 4:
That frustrates you?

03:18 Speaker 2:
I don't know. I just was gonna let you go see if I could play

03:22 Speaker 3:
A pet peeve.

03:24 Speaker 1:
Like the most frustrating, even like type of player. I think we talked about this a little bit when we were talking about ID camps and you were like, you hate the player that's like in the ID camp.

03:33 Speaker 2:
Oh, that's so, that's so, 'cause it was very opposite of how you are. Yeah,

03:36 Speaker 1:
It was opposite

03:36 Speaker 2:
Of how I, I'm like, I don't, I don't care about the player that's coming in my face all the time and Brooke does. Well no, I That's what, when I was part of podcast, whisper podcast, but like, it's not, but I also understand it. Yeah, I understand it. I just, I was never that, so I'm always like aware of like everybody at the camp. Yeah. One the ones that aren't, aren't extroverted, that are more like quiet but still kind of, I'm just like, I try to be aware of that a little bit more than Yeah.

04:10 Speaker 2:
Of the, I'm say

04:13 Speaker 3:
My pet peeve, and this is like an incredibly targeted one, is when specific goalkeepers don't wash their gloves.

04:21 Speaker 4:
<laugh>. Ooh. Oh, the face. The it's gotta be one girl that I can

04:26 Speaker 1:
Oh

04:26 Speaker 2:
No, there's two. We're two for two. Oh, we have two goalies. Oh my goodness. Goalies. Wash

04:31 Speaker 4:
Your gloves. Wash your gloves.

04:33 Speaker 2:
I have smelled those gloves from afar. Same.

04:37 Speaker 1:
That

04:37 Speaker 2:
Shouldn't be something that should happen.

04:40 Speaker 1:
The rest of them taking their gloves off is enough to send me across the locker room. Out of the facility.

04:46 Speaker 2:
Out of the facility. Did you

04:47 Speaker 1:
Wash your gloves all the time? How many times a week?

04:50 Speaker 2:
Morgan also sanitizes her hands more than anybody that I've ever met. Wow. Actually, like anytime she goes

04:56 Speaker 4:
Around to gloves from the

04:59 Speaker 2:
Don't have some, I'm like, but like in the everyday life I'm like, should I be putting some <laugh>? I I just wash my hands. Didn't. Yeah. Yeah. I'm always very, I'm impressed with, so I'm like, must sanitize before. So it my lifestyle. Very sanitized. Very sanitized.

05:17 Speaker 4:
Well, good advice. Don't, don't be overly round nosing at the ID

05:22 Speaker 2:
Clinic. Be however your authentic self is. Okay. Fair. It's just something that I notice.

05:26 Speaker 4:
But as you're being your authentic self, please wash your gloves. <laugh>.

05:30 Speaker 2:
Yeah. Wash your gloves. We don't for everybody's sake.

05:35 Speaker 1:
Perfect for everybody's. And then what would you tell an incoming college soccer player to know that you wish your 18-year-old self knew?

05:43 Speaker 4:
Top thing? One thing.

05:44 Speaker 2:
Top one thing. <affirmative>. Oh man. I had to go into college injured, you know, <laugh>. Well, you're welcome everyone. <laugh>. I just, I would into life advice here. Okay. Into life. Advice. Could be anything though. It could be why

06:05 Speaker 3:
Could be out field

06:06 Speaker 2:
Too. What do you got?

06:10 Speaker 3:
I like, this isn't, I always say like, see what's the thing say the forest truth. Is that the thing? Like, you're gonna be so life coming at you fast. You're far from home, you're not with your parents. Having them kind of cater to you and do everything. Your season goes, your first season goes by so fast. But it's, look at the big picture about what you're learning about yourself, how you're engaging with your teammates, you engaging with your staff. The resources around here, I would just see, don't get so stuck in what's right in front of your face that you're not noticing all the other great things that are there because it goes by so fast and just don't take that for granted.

06:50 Speaker 2:
Yeah. I think for me, I think try to experience as much as you can. I, I learned so much while I was at college, coming from Norwalk, Iowa up to Minneapolis. I, I, it was kind of an eyeopener and I think like spending time with people outside the team, obviously, honestly my best friends are still people that I played soccer with. So really embrace the friendships that you're gonna have in college. I know Brooke, I know you're gonna have those friends forever.

07:22 Speaker 2:
Like those are, those are really important relationships and make sure you invest in them, but, and also make sure that you're experiencing things outside of that world and getting as much out of the college experience as you can along with and within soccer, because you only have four years of it. College soccer, you only have four years of it now again. But, but like as, as of now, again, Brooks only having four years. So yeah. Like I think that that's, that's a really important thing that now that I take a step back, as Morgan said, I think that that was really, I loved my experience because of that and I'm grateful for my experience because of the relationships that I built on and off the field with the players I played with and others.

08:10 Speaker 2:
<laugh> the beyond. Others. The others. Yes. The Muggles.

08:14 Speaker 3:
I'd say too with that, like you have such a cool platform as a student athlete, like engage in your community. We have an incredible community here, but kind of speaking solely to by experience at LSU, like Baton Rouge was a community that loved LSU and having that platform as a student athlete and being able to like, engage with little kids or just different local schools or different programs and stuff was something that should not be passed up. Like that was something that, as I look back, like those are some of the most meaningful moments from my college career and I still keep in contact with a decent amount of those people.

08:50 Speaker 3:
So that's been, that'd be a huge piece of advice. Jump into your community.

08:56 Speaker 4:
Jumping on in, jumping

08:57 Speaker 3:
On in,

08:58 Speaker 4:
Are we going from the lightning round?
